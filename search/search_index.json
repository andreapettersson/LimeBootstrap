Lime Bootstrap uses \nknockoutjs\n \nModel-View-ViewModel (MVVM)\n pattern.\n\n\nThe view\n\n\nThe view is a piece of HTML which descripes where elements should be placed. In the view we \nbind\n the data and functions of the \nViewModel\n to the view. Each ActionPad has an unique view, which is a partial html-file with the same name as the LimeType it is used with, for example `company.html``\n\n\nIn the \nview\nwe make heavy use of \ncomponents\n\n\nThe ViewModel\n\n\nThe ViewModel is a Javascript object containing your data and functions to interact with the View. You don't have any direct access to the ViewModel when building ActionPads. For direct access to a ViewModel you need to create a \nCustom Components\n. You have some indirect access to the ViewModel of an ActionPad through specifing which \ndata sources\n should be used in the file \n_config.js\n.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nAll framework configuration is done in the file \n_config.js\n. Here you can load additional data, enabling the debug mode or load custom components.\n\n\nlbs\n.\nexternalConfig\n \n=\n \n{\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n    Enable or disable the debug-logging\n\n\n    */\n\n    \ndebug\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n    Verbose levels:\n\n\n        debug   :   Shows all log levels\n\n\n        info    :   Shows information level and up\n\n\n        warn    :   Shows warning level and up\n\n\n        error   :   Shows only error level logs\n\n\n    */\n\n    \nverboseLevel\n:\n \n'warn'\n,\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n    Load custom components\n\n\n    */\n\n    \ncomponents\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n \nname\n:\n \n'my-component'\n,\n \npath\n:\n \n'components/my-comp/my-comp.js'\n \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n    Datasources to be used for each view\n\n\n    */\n\n    \nconfig\n:\n{\n\n        \nhelpdesk\n \n:\n \n{\n\n            \ndataSources\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n{\n \ntype\n:\n \n'activeLimeObject'\n,\n \nembed\n:\n \n[\n'person'\n]\n \n},\n\n                \n{\n \ntype\n:\n \n'translation'\n \n},\n\n                \n{\n \ntype\n:\n \n'relatedLimeObjects'\n,\n \nlimetype\n:\n \n'person'\n,\n \nalias\n:\n \n'person'\n \n},\n\n            \n]\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nComponents are self contained specialized html elements, for example \n<lbs-hero>\n. We are using \nknockout components\n behind the scenes to create the components, but in essens it is very inspired of the emerging webstandard of web components. Several components are \nincluded\n but you have also the ability to \nbuild your own components\n or download community components from the \nAppStore\n\n\nSee all our components \nhere\n\n\nCustom Components and Apps\n\n\nLime Bootstraps allows you to create and custom components, as a compliment to the included components. Lime Bootstrap 1 had the concept of creating small apps. These apps still run fine in Lime Bootstrap 2.0, but it is prefered to use components.\n\n\nComponents and Apps can be found \nhere\n\n\nA Custom Component is added in \n_config.js\n and can then be used in the same way as any included component.\n\n\nTo start an app add this HTML to your view:\n\n\n<\ndiv\n \ndata-app\n=\n\"{app:'[Name of app]',\n\n\n                config:{\n\n\n                  [App config]\n\n\n            }}\"\n>\n\n\n</\ndiv\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach app has it's own instructions how to start and install them. Some apps require VBA and/or stored procedures to be added.\n\n\nTranslation\n\n\nAll available translations from the Localization table are automatically available in the actionpad context. The same language as the logged in user uses is automatically used. The translations are cached in a dictionary to increase speed, but requires you to run \nThisApplication.Setup\n to rebuild the dictionary if you add translations or make changes.\n\n\n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text:localize.ActionPad_Todo.addTodo\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example below uses the versatile knockout binding \nattr\n to add a tooltip with localization support. It also uses the custom Lime Bootstrap bindings \nvba\n and \nicon\n.\n\n\n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"vba:'Actionpad_Person.newComment', text:localize.Actionpad_Person.t_newcomment, icon:'fa-comment', attr: { title: localize.Actionpad_Person.tooltip_newcomment }\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical notes\n\n\nThe translations are added to the global view model and are thus available in your apps.\n\n\nNote that it is not possible to use localization in the standard way, e.g., \nlocalize.Actionpad_Person.t_newcomment\n within a block where you are using the knockout binding \nwith\n.\n\n\nFetching data from fields in Lime CRM\n\n\nAll fields from the ActiveInspector are automagically available for you to use in your view.

            "text": "Bindings and Filters\n\n\nBindings\n\n\nAs we relay heavily on knockout their \ndata-bind=\"\"\n syntax is used through out the framework. The \ndata-bind=\"\"\n syntax is a used as a property on an html element. In a \ndata-bind\n you add \nbindings\n, actions or triggers, to perform actions. All Knockout bindings are available, but also a few custom bindings to make your life easier.\nRead more about bindings and Knockout \nhere\n and try the tutorial \nhere\n\n\nA basic example of use of a knockout binding:\n\n\n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text:company.name\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use a short hand for bindnings, using brackets. The above example can also be written as\n\n\n<\nli\n>\n{{company.name}}\n</\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about this short hand syntax \nhere\n\n\nAs default you only have access to the data of the ActiveInspector!\n\n\nKnockout bindings\n\n\nKnockout supplies a large set of bindings, which all can be found \nhere\n\n\nSome of the more common and useful bindings\n\n\n\n\nvisible:\n - \nhides or shows a html element based on an boolean expression\n\n\ntext:\n - \nDisplays a variable as text\n\n\nhtml:\n - \nPrepends the supplied font awesome icon to the html element\n\n\ncss:\n - \nAdd or remove CSS classes\n\n\nstyle:\n - \nAdd styling attributes\n\n\nattr\n - \nSet value of any html attribute\n\n\nforeach:\n - \nLoop through an array\n\n\n\n\nvbaVisible: Hiding or showing elements\n\n\nIt is common that some elements only should be visible for certain users or when specific conditions apply. It can be done in two different ways. Either use the Lime Bootstrap data-binding \nvbaVisible:\n or use the knockout binding \nvisible:\n.\n\n\nThe \nvbaVisible:\n is used as follows. A VBA function is called, handling the logic whether the element should be visible or not, returning a boolean.\n\ntrue:\n Element is visible\n\nfalse:\n Element hidden\n\n\nIn complex cases the VBA-function can take input parameters to reduce the number of VBA functions required.\n\n\n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"vbaVisible:'ActionPad_Helpdesk.HideLinks, take'\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use knockout's built in handler \nvisible:\n to hide or show elements. Any valid Javascript will be evaluated. Example:\n\n\n<!-- Shows an bootstrap alert if the todo is late. Moment.js is used to parse and handle dates.-->\n\n\n<\ndiv\n \nclass\n=\n\"alert alert-error\"\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"\n\n\n   visible: todo.endtime.value !== null && (moment(todo.endtime.value) < moment() && todo.done.value != 1),\n\n\n   text: 'The task is ' + (todo.endtime.value != null ? moment(todo.endtime.value).fromNow(true) : '' )+ ' late!',\n\n\n   icon:'fa-bell'\"\n \n>\n\n\n</\ndiv\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe binding \nvbaVisible:\n is only able to execute a given VBA function that returns true or false. If you need to add some kind of code on top of that VBA function, use the original knockout binding \nvisible:\n instead. This example uses the opposite of the function result, but any other javascript code would also work fine.\n\n\n<\ndiv\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"visible:!lbs.common.executeVba('App_MoveDate.moveDaysPossible')\"\n>\n\n...\n\n</\ndiv\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvba: Executing VBA-functions and specific actions\n\n\nvba:\n is used to trigger VBA-functions and specific actions on click. To call a VBA function simply use:\n\n\n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"vba:'ActionPad_Helpdesk.Take'\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput parameters are provided by simply separating them by commas.\n\n\n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"vba:'ActionPad_Helpdesk.Park, 1, t_park_1_hour'\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use any available data in the actionpad as an input to the function through concatenating a string\n\n\n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"vba:'ActionPad_Helpdesk.DoSomethingWithTheRecord,' + helpdesk.idhelpdesk.value\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n ```\n\n\n### showOnMap: Showing an address on a map\n\n*   __showOnMap:__ - Searches Google Maps for the provided address.\n\n```html\n    \n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text:company.postalcity.text, showOnMap: company.fullpostaladdress.text, icon: 'fa-map-marker'\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall: Call a phone number\n\n\n\n\ncall:\n - Ads an tel: link to the HTML wich triggers an built in softphone software.\n\n\n\n\n    \n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text: company.phone.text, call: company.phone.text, icon: 'fa-phone'\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopenURL: Go to a website\n\n\n\n\nopenURL:\n - Opens the suplied URL in an external browser\n\n\n\n\n     \n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text:company.www.text, openURL: company.www.text, icon: 'fa-globe'\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimeLink: Go to another Lime Record\n\n\n\n\nlimeLink\n - Tries to create an Lime link to the object provided, please note that the root node of the object is used and not a specific property.\n\n\n\n\n    \n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text:todo.company.text, limeLink:todo.company, icon:'fa-flag'\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemail: Send an email\n\n\n\n\nemail\n - Creates an email.

In its simplest form, it can be used to display informative texts. It can also be initialized as an object with one or several adjustable attributes, allowing for styling both header icon and title. There are also a few pre-defined types with their own set designs.\n\n\n\n\n        \n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"popover: 'This is a popover'\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the popover is initialized as an object, the following attributes can be configured:\n\n* __icon__\n\nAny of the icons available from Font Awesome.\n\n* __text__\n\nText you want to be displayed.\n\n* __title__\n\nTitle to be displayed in the header section of the popover.\n\n* __color__\n\nBackground color of the header section. All header-colors are avalible.\n\n* __trigger__\n\nWhat event will trigger the event. Only two values are valid here:\n*   hover\n*   click\n\nwhere the default value is 'hover'.\n\n* __placement__\n\nWhere the popover will be displayed in relation to its parent element. The following values are valid here:\n*   top\n*   right\n*   bottom\n*   left\n\nwhere the default value is 'top'.\n\n* __type__\n\nWhat template (if any) should be used. Only the following values are valid:\n*   success\n*   info\n*   error\n*   warning\n*   custom\n\nwhere the default value is 'custom'. The top four alternatives will override all values for 'color', 'title' and 'icon'. These will be replaced by template ones for the specific types.\n\n* __Example without template__\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n \npopover:{\n\n                        \ntext:\n'\nThis\n \nis\n \na\n \npopover\n',\n\n                        \ntitle:\n \n'\nLBS\n \nrules\n',\n\n                        \ntype:\n \n'\ncustom\n',\n\n                        \ncolor:\n'\nmagenta\n',\n\n                        \ntrigger:\n \n'\nclick\n',\n\n                        \nicon:\n \n'\nfa-check\n',\n\n                        \nplacement:\n \n'\ntop\n'\n\n                    \n},\n \ntext:\n \n'\nPopoverclick\n'\"\n>\n\">\n</\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* __Example with template__\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"popover:{text:'This is a popover.',type:'info'}\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntooltip: Show a helping tooltip\n\n\n\n\ntooltip\n - Gives you a good looking tooltip. \nBootstrap\n. You can design where you like the tooltip to show by sending a object with a placement.\n\n\n\n\n        \n<\na\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text:'Andreas', tooltip: 'Konsult'\"\n></\na\n>\n\n        \n<\na\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text:'Andreas', tooltip: {text:'Konsult',placement:'right'}\"\n></\na\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nA filter in knockout is a way of 'piping' a text binding through a pre-defined filter to format the value in a desired way. The filter is initiated using the | sign followed by the name of the filter and any necessary parameter inputs to the filter.\n\n\nFilters are a smart and easy way to format your data in a binding\nA filter is a function transforming your binding data and outputting a formated version of it.\n\n\n<\nli\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text:deal.value | currency: SEK\"\n></\nli\n>\n\n\n<\nli\n>\n{{deal.value | currency: SEK}}\n</\nli\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will produce a nicely formated value of a deal, example: \"10 000SEK\"\n\n\nList of filters:\n\n\n\n\ndefault:\n - If the value is blank, null, or an empty array, replace it with the given default value.\n\n\nfit:\n[:\n][:\n]\n - Trim the value if it\u2019s longer than the given length. The trimmed portion is replaced with ... or the replacement value, if given. By default, the value is trimmed on the right but can be changed to left or middle through the where option. For example: name | fit:10::'middle' will convert Shakespeare to Shak...are.\n\n\njson[:space]\n - Convert the value to a JSON string using ko.toJSON. You can give a space value to format the JSON output.\n\n\nlowercase\n - Convert the value to lowercase.\n\n\nnumber:\n - Rounds a number of desired number of decimals\n\n\nreplace:\n:\n - Perform a search and replace on the value using String#replace.\n\n\nuppercase\n - Convert the value to uppercase.\n\n\ncurrency:\n:\n - Formats a number with to a currency with a space a separate every \n number. Default 1000\n\n\npercent:\n - Formats a decimal number as percent 0,01 > 1%\n\n\nfromNow:\n - Formats a date as a human readable text as for how long ago the date was. Example 2000-01-01 > \"Over ten years ago\"\n\n\n\n\nCurrency\n\n\nThe currency filter can be combined with a text data-bind to format a number as a currency. The filter takes two optional parameters - currency and divider. The currency is the unit in which you want to present the formatted number, e.g. $ or GBP or SEK. The divider lets you decide what delimiter to use for formatting the number.\n\n\n<\ndiv\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text: 100000 | currency:'$':','\"\n></\ndiv\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis filter will format the number 100000 as $100,000. The following code\n\n\n<\ndiv\n \ndata-bind\n=\n\"text: 100000 | currency:'SEK'\"\n></\ndiv\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill result in the formatted value 100 000 SEK.",

The trimmed portion is replaced with ... or the replacement value, if given. By default, the value is trimmed on the right but can be changed to left or middle through the where option. For example: name | fit:10::'middle' will convert Shakespeare to Shak...are.  json[:space]  - Convert the value to a JSON string using ko.toJSON. You can give a space value to format the JSON output.  lowercase  - Convert the value to lowercase.  number:  - Rounds a number of desired number of decimals  replace: :  - Perform a search and replace on the value using String#replace.  uppercase  - Convert the value to uppercase.  currency: :  - Formats a number with to a currency with a space a separate every   number.

The data is converted to a view-model (In this case the view model is just a JSON represenation of the data)\n4. Additional resources are loaded to the app\n5. The view-model is supplied to the app and cam be modified\n6. The app view is loaded from app.html.\n7. The view and view-model is rendered and injected to the actionpad\n\n\nInitiation of an app is executed by the \nlbs.apploader.js\n module and triggered by an \ndata-app:\n-attribute.\n\n\nThe data can be provided as XML, record or records and limebootstrap will then supply the app with an View-model based on the data, free for you to work with.

The business logic and dataconnection is allways performed by the VBA. This functionallity should be inside a single module.  The general idea of an app is to implement:   A function or procedure to deliver data. VBA or SQL, can deliver data as xml, record or records.  A view - An html template with the structure of your app.  A view-model - the viewmodel holds a rednering and frontend logic   An app is initilaized as:\n1. The app is loaded and the config of the app is parsed\n2. Data is loaded from Lime CRM, from your supplied function\n3. The data is converted to a view-model (In this case the view model is just a JSON represenation of the data)\n4. Additional resources are loaded to the app\n5. The view-model is supplied to the app and cam be modified\n6. The app view is loaded from app.html.\n7. The view and view-model is rendered and injected to the actionpad  Initiation of an app is executed by the  lbs.apploader.js  module and triggered by an  data-app: -attribute.  The data can be provided as XML, record or records and limebootstrap will then supply the app with an View-model based on the data, free for you to work with. In the view model you will also find all translations and avilable data from the current actionpad viewmodel.  < div   data-app = \"{app:'checklist',config:{canBeUnchecked:true,allowRemove:true, canAddTask:true}} \"   ></ div >   Please note that you can not have a  data-app  and  data-bind  attribute in the same element",

Views (basically html-templates) and data(usually JSON) are loaded via AJAX (an asyncrounous javacript call) by the the web application. The template is then rendered by applying the data and the result is shown to the user.\n\n\nIn Lime-bootstraps case lbs.html and lbs.js constitute the main application and all Actionpads set to show \nlbs.html\n. For simplification we'll call the framework just \nLBS\n (Lime Bootstrap). \nlbs.html\n contians all included CSS, JS and meta tags. The Actionpads (for example company.html) are now just views, containing no included CSS or JS.\n\n\nlbs.html will detemine which view to load either by a supplied query string (the thing after the questionmark), \n../lbs.html?ap=company\n or if nothing is supplied, by trying to load a view with the same name as the class of the Lime inspector.\n\n\nThe active inspectors record is then loaded as data and converted to JSON.\n\n\nBasic flow in LBS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBS starts and includes all base CSS, Javascript and sets a lot of environment variables, such as skin color, language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBS then checks where you want your display your HTML-view. In Lime you can show HTML in the Actionpad, in a field, in a tab or in a web dialog. If you don't specify anything lbs will assume your building an Actionpad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe specified view, html-file, is loaded\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData is loaded. LBS will first check \n_config.js\n for datasources, specified with the name of the view. If no datasources are found LBS will try to load the data from the \nActiveInspector\n. A dictionary of local languages translations is loaded. All data is supplied as a JSON-object and then converted to a knockout viewmodel-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps are discovered, started and their data is loaded into the main viewmodel. A app can specify depencies on other libraries or styles. These are dynamically loaded and checked for duplicates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe viewmodel is applied to the now complete view and rendered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading views\n\n\nAs metioned lbs.html is the real engine and all HTML things should be loaded trough lbs.html. This is achieved by supplying a query string\n\n\n[URL to Actionpad folder]/lbs.html?ap=[path to your view/view name]\n\n\nThe path is relative the lbs.html file and you should not include the file extension (.html).\n\n\nLoading the company Actionpad (company.html):\n\n\nlbs.html?ap=company\n\n\nThe console and debugging your applications\n\n\nThe framework has been blessed with a virtual console, to use for debugging. It is activated through changing \ndebug: true,\n in \n_config.js\n. The console will allways automagically appeare if a critical error is logged. If you make syntacic errors in the wrong place, even the viritual console will crash. You can easily use the console when building apps, read more abot this in the app readme. The console is limited to 30 messages by default.\n\n\nWhen working with more advanced stuff you might like to have access to a real console. Modern browsers won't allow dynamically loadings scripts from the local file system, due to security concerns. Dynamically loading scripts and html views are core concepts in LBS. In Lime a small VBA function acts as the loader. However in \nsystem/bin/\n you will find a \n.bat-file\n which will restart Google Chrome in a debug mode, allowing you to inspect the CSS and JS. If you dislike this approach a small HTTP-server will do the trick. With Python3 just go to the actionpad folder and write this in your terminal:\n\n\n$python\n -m http.server\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent wrappers\n\n\nIn Lime HTML can be displayed in the actionpad, in a HTML-field, in a HTML-tab and in a HTML-dialog. Theses places are quite different and requires some basic setup to work well. Your view can thus be loaded into three different wrappers for helping you with the different conditions.\n\n\nThe three basic wrappers of content:\n\n\n\n\nActionpad-wrapper\n. A thin and long wrapper with a slightly lighter background images with a sharp edge to teh rest of the content:\n\n\nInline-wrapper\n. Used for HTML-fields. Completely plain, with the same color as the Inspector and no padding or margin. Built to seamlessly look as a part of the inspector.\n\n\nTab-wrapper\n. Used for wider layouts, such as a tab or a dialog. Uses default Twitter Bootstrap margins and is fully responsive.\n\n\n\n\nThe Actionpad wrapper is allways used unless anything else is stated. Pick your wrapper by suppling a querystring to lbs.html\n\n\n__Inline:\n \nlbs.html?type=inline\n\n\n_Tab:\n \nlbs.html?type=tab\n\n\nWhen working with tabs, fields or dialogs it is easiest to use VBA to set the URL. Example:\n\n\n    ActiveInspector.Controls.SetValue(\"htmlfield\", WebFolder & \"lbs.html?ap=foo&type=inline\")\n\n\n\n\n\nLogic in bindnings\n\n\nKnockout lets you write JavaScript expressions directly in the bindnings. This is a really simple and powerful way of doing cool stuff. Word of advice: Too much logic in the view isn't nice at all.

Views (basically html-templates) and data(usually JSON) are loaded via AJAX (an asyncrounous javacript call) by the the web application. The template is then rendered by applying the data and the result is shown to the user.  In Lime-bootstraps case lbs.html and lbs.js constitute the main application and all Actionpads set to show  lbs.html . For simplification we'll call the framework just  LBS  (Lime Bootstrap).  lbs.html  contians all included CSS, JS and meta tags. The Actionpads (for example company.html) are now just views, containing no included CSS or JS.  lbs.html will detemine which view to load either by a supplied query string (the thing after the questionmark),  ../lbs.html?ap=company  or if nothing is supplied, by trying to load a view with the same name as the class of the Lime inspector.  The active inspectors record is then loaded as data and converted to JSON.  Basic flow in LBS:    LBS starts and includes all base CSS, Javascript and sets a lot of environment variables, such as skin color, language.    LBS then checks where you want your display your HTML-view. In Lime you can show HTML in the Actionpad, in a field, in a tab or in a web dialog. If you don't specify anything lbs will assume your building an Actionpad.    The specified view, html-file, is loaded    Data is loaded. LBS will first check  _config.js  for datasources, specified with the name of the view. If no datasources are found LBS will try to load the data from the  ActiveInspector . A dictionary of local languages translations is loaded. All data is supplied as a JSON-object and then converted to a knockout viewmodel-    Apps are discovered, started and their data is loaded into the main viewmodel. A app can specify depencies on other libraries or styles. These are dynamically loaded and checked for duplicates.    The viewmodel is applied to the now complete view and rendered.",

You can easily use the console when building apps, read more abot this in the app readme. The console is limited to 30 messages by default.  When working with more advanced stuff you might like to have access to a real console. Modern browsers won't allow dynamically loadings scripts from the local file system, due to security concerns. Dynamically loading scripts and html views are core concepts in LBS. In Lime a small VBA function acts as the loader. However in  system/bin/  you will find a  .bat-file  which will restart Google Chrome in a debug mode, allowing you to inspect the CSS and JS. If you dislike this approach a small HTTP-server will do the trick. With Python3 just go to the actionpad folder and write this in your terminal:  $python  -m http.server",

A thin and long wrapper with a slightly lighter background images with a sharp edge to teh rest of the content:  Inline-wrapper . Used for HTML-fields. Completely plain, with the same color as the Inspector and no padding or margin. Built to seamlessly look as a part of the inspector.  Tab-wrapper . Used for wider layouts, such as a tab or a dialog. Uses default Twitter Bootstrap margins and is fully responsive.   The Actionpad wrapper is allways used unless anything else is stated. Pick your wrapper by suppling a querystring to lbs.html  __Inline:   lbs.html?type=inline  _Tab:   lbs.html?type=tab  When working with tabs, fields or dialogs it is easiest to use VBA to set the URL.
